# RSC Behavior Rules And Guidelines

## Breakdowns, Explanations, And Philosophies 1 Introduction

### 1.1 TL;DR

1.1.1 Don’t be a jerk and don’t be immature.
1.1.2 Remember there are kids in the server. Strong language is fine, though don’t direct it at others; slurs, in any form, are not okay.
1.1.3 Don’t spam.
1.1.4 Stick to the right channels for the topic you want to discuss.
1.1.5 Speak English.
1.1.6 Use pings appropriately; never ping pointlessly. Don’t ping between midnight and noon ET unless it’s an individual who was online within the last few minutes.
1.1.7 If you are in an event, don’t leave the server; don’t leave during the season at all if you are a member of a league.
1.1.8 Don’t spoil media that has been released within the last month.

### 1.3 What Is This?

1.3.1 Breakdowns
1.3.1.1 Each of the misbehaviors listed in the new behavior rules are listed below, along with a breakdown of what is and isn’t permitted, where moderation discretion may be more or less critical, and anything else that may be relevant.
1.3.2 Explanations
1.3.2.1 Each misbehavior is accompanied in this document by an explanation, to the best of the staff’s ability to explain, as to why it is a rule, and anything else we feel is germane to the discussion of these rules.
1.3.3 Philosophies
1.3.3.1 This document also contains philosophies of rule creation, community inclusivity, and moderation. Though this is listed third in the title and is the least likely reason for an average member of the community to look at this document, this section comes before the behavior guidelines themselves. This is because they inform everything else in this document. Many arguments over whether or not something should be a rule is because the sides have conflicting views on these three areas.
1.3.4 Moderator Manual And Training Guide
1.3.4.1 This serves as a guide for moderation in RSC. Additionally, it works as a core part of the process of bringing on new moderators.

## 2 Philosophies

### 2.1 Community Inclusivity

2.1.1 Summary
2.1.1.1 RSC should make people feel welcome.
2.1.1.2 RSC should not discriminate.
2.1.1.3 RSC members should not fear discrimination or attack from being present in the server.
2.1.1.4 RSC will select for positions and opportunities based on estimated maturity level.
2.1.1.5 RSC should not ignore the concerns of its members, especially about the behavior of other members.
2.1.2 RSC is for everyone. That does not mean that everyone will enjoy every part of RSC’s events. That does not mean that everyone will enjoy even a single RSC event. That does not mean that everyone will be friends, or even that everyone will get along. It does mean that RSC will endeavor to not turn people away when they have given us no cause to do so. It does mean that RSC will endeavor to make people feel welcome. It does mean that we will punish or ban individuals as needed if they harm this cause. It does not mean we will punish or ban an individual because a single other person does not want them there.
2.1.3 RSC does not discriminate against individuals based on their age, parental status, career/employment status, hobbies, disabilities, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, lawful sexual activity, marital status, physical features, political beliefs or activity, physical conditions, race, ethnicity, religious beliefs or activities, social class, origins, or association with others based on any of the above characteristics. We may place limits on participation in specific events based on some of these characteristics, such as age (example: a tournament for those 30 and up, or those under 18). We will only ever do so in a polite, respectful, and fair way, when possible seeking to help some group through additional opportunities for them.
2.1.4 RSC should be a safe space, in the sense that people should not fear discrimination in any of the above categories, nor should they fear personal attacks. It does not mean that people will be shielded from new ideas, nor does it mean that we can prevent individuals from being put in situations that may affect them negatively due to their own history. It does not mean that RSC is opposed to freedom of speech. It does mean that we will not respect any “right” that individuals may feel they have to harm others through words or actions. It does mean that there should be rules of behavior to indicate what individuals should be prepared to encounter, and what they should expect to see punished.
2.1.5 RSC does not discriminate based on age, but it does reserve the right to discriminate based on maturity level. Some individuals, be they five or fifty-five, may act immaturely with great enough frequency that RSC may block them from taking up certain roles or participating in certain events. Maturity of an individual will be judged primarily based on two things: their ability to follow rules and their interactions with members of RSC.
2.1.6 RSC should pay attention to the concerns of its members, particularly in regards to the behaviors of others. If a member reports a concern about another member’s behavior, regardless of who the behavior was directed at or the severity of the offense, RSC should not forget the matter. RSC should endeavor to follow up with concerns according to the behavior rules and guidelines.

### 2.2 Moderation

2.2.1 Moderation should be done confidently. Moderators should feel empowered to enforce the rules. They should not feel like they will have their every action questioned.
2.2.2 Moderators should not be expected to be perfect, by the staff or the community. Mistakes happen. Apologies will need to be delivered, by the individual in question when possible and by the staff as a whole when needed.
2.2.3 Moderation should be as swift as is reasonably possible. Delayed consequences lead to lesser effect, and more disconnect between the event and the consequences. They can also lead to a snowballing effect in the community, leading to more trouble and encouraging others to commit similar misbehaviors.
2.2.4 Moderators should present a united front. Moderators may not always agree, but public argument leads to a reduction of faith in RSC staff. Disagreement should be handled in staff-only channels, and a final resolution be presented to the public as needed. Should moderation be recognized as probably problematic by the staff, lesser punishments (such as temporary mutes) should stay while greater punishments (such as match suspensions) should be lifted until a consensus is reached. Public statements should be minimal until a final official statement can be made.​
2.2.5 Moderators should be as clear as possible when moderating. Specific rules should be referenced when broken. Catch-all misbehavior categories may be used when others do not fit, with several strikes delivered if needed. Members should be able to DM and ask questions. They are not entitled to more than one clear explanation, however, nor is a moderator expected to deal with a debate for every punished misbehavior. Not debating does not make the moderator’s decision wrong. If a player wishes to make a formal complaint or have a moderator’s behavior looked at by others, they should contact the Mod Committee head, or use the RSC Modmail bot to contact RSC staff.
2.2.5 Moderators should not expect discussion before every moderation call. Any discussion should happen after the first moderator to respond chooses to take action or chooses not to. A moderator who chooses to not take action may change their mind.
2.2.6 For moderation calls of lesser consequence (where the punishments are things like simple timeouts, or where there are levels of warnings built into the system), moderators should lean towards preferring more decisive moderation. For moderation calls of greater consequence (suspensions or other cases where the individual is missing out on events of great importance to RSC), moderators should act with caution. For cases of permanent or difficult-to-undo moderation (bans), there should always be a reasonable amount of discussion first, except in rare cases (such as blatant spammers). This should never lead to someone not receiving punishment for rules they’ve broken in accordance with currently set-out consequences.
2.2.7 Moderators who are still being trained or otherwise limited should always defer to full moderators. Moderators should defer to admins. Any other set indicators of hierarchy in the staff should be obeyed. This does not mean silent acceptance, but it does mean not going against their final declarations on matters. Defiance of the set hierarchy in a non-constructive manner (such as making public references in a disrespectful manner) is an indication that an individual is too immature to moderate fairly and reasonably.
2.2.9 Moderators are not beholden to understanding the full context of a situation. Context of a misbehavior that reaches outside of the RSC Discord should be ignored by moderators, except as is made clear inside of the RSC Discord by members shortly before or after the misbehavior. (Note that videos, GIFs, long texts, or other material that takes some effort to absorb does not count as providing clear context.) Moderators are not expected to understand every reference made by members, and will have to judge each situation without external references except in rare cases. Even in the case of a moderator understanding a reference, they should consider how members who do not know the reference would see it, and if it breaks a rule without that context. Moderators should pay attention to misbehaviors in the context of past misbehaviors only in how they might make a misbehavior more severe.​
2.2.10 Moderators should go outside of the set structure of consequences as rarely as possible. Leniency should be set by the structure and the rules, and further leniency should be given only very rarely. Harsher consequences than set forth in the rules should be given even more rarely. (Cases of multiple strikes for a single action, when following the guidelines given, do not count as going outside of the rules.)
2.2.11 Moderators are not the parents of the community. They have no obligation to try and teach you morality or improve your attitude in your out-of-RSC life. We are trying to run a community that is pleasant to be in. Therefore, there is a cut-off point where it is highly unlikely that a trouble-causing individual will improve their behavior, and they should be banned if the trouble is severe enough or occurred frequently enough. Likewise, there is a cut-off point for moderators taking time to ensure members understand the rules.
2.2.12 Moderators of both the RSCC and RSCSC(1v1) servers will moderate collaboratively. Strikes will accumulate collectively across both servers. Any member of either server that is struck in one league will serve punishments in both league servers.
2.2.13 If you leave either server while you have a contract in progress, you will be suspended from playing for both the current seasons. This only applies if you are on contract when you leave the server, it does not apply if you leave as a free agent or in offseason.

### 2.3 Rule And Consequence Creation

2.3.1 Clearer rules are better than vague rules. Moderator discretion is an important part of moderation, but the community should not have to rely on learning the personalities and tolerance levels of moderators in order to avoid breaking rules and receiving consequences.
2.3.2 Simpler rules are better than more complex rules. More complex rules are better than rules that are frequently misinterpreted.
2.3.3 Doing a misbehavior twice is worse than doing it once. Consequences should follow a logical scaling with repetition.
2.3.4 Consequences should be set in advance whenever possible.
2.3.5 Cases of bans should always be reviewed before an actual ban occurs (barring rare cases, usually related to spam or non-person members); they should instead receive an alternative severe punishment if the ban does not occur.
2.3.6 How consequences scale should reflect the severity of the misbehavior committed. Consequences may scale both in the severity of the starting and ending punishments, and by the linearity of the increase in severity as repetition of a misbehavior increases (that is, how quickly the punishments get worse).
2.3.6.1 Misbehaviors that are reasonably well defined should have no more than a single warning.
2.3.6.2 Misbehaviors that are vague or that heavily rely on context should have multiple levels of warnings, or else have their consequences scale up more slowly.
2.3.6.3 Misbehaviors that are minor should have lesser consequences throughout.
2.3.6.4 Misbehaviors that are serious should have rapidly increasing consequences and end with a ban
2.3.6.5 Misbehaviors that are extremely minor should not directly lead to an assumed ban.
2.3.6.6 Misbehaviors that are extremely serious should not use the full punishment scale before reaching a ban.
2.3.6.7 Misbehaviors that are commonly seen as misbehaviors should skip or minimize warnings before more severe consequences are delivered.
2.3.6.8 Misbehaviors that are inconsistently seen as misbehaviors should always deliver at least one level of warning.
2.3.6.9 Misbehaviors that are potentially harmful to the community as a whole and the reputation of RSC should be punished more severely than those harmful to individuals and smaller groups
2.3.6.10 Misbehaviors that are likely to be misunderstood by the moderators should start with warnings and ramp up consequences slowly
2.3.6.11 Misbehaviors that severely harm the reputation of an individual/group should be punished more severely, and consequently more quickly lead to a ban.
2.3.6.12 Misbehaviors that harm the integrity of RSCC or another RSC event, or their ability to operate smoothly, should be punished more severely and more quickly lead to a ban from the event.
2.3.6.13 Misbehaviors that are highly likely to be intentionally planned or performed with malicious intent should receive one or no warnings and rapidly increase in severity of consequence.
2.3.6.14 Misbehaviors that involve circumventing the structures and rules of RSC should be punished harshly and quickly lead to a ban.
2.3.6.14.1 Example: If you “fix” a game in RSCC, you should incur an RSCC penalty.
2.3.6.7 When a misbehavior happens, a player’s general manager will be notified of the misbehavior and where the member stands with their strikes.

## 3 Behavior Rules (In No Particular Order)

### 3.1 General Misbehaviors

3.1.1 Being generally disrespectful, rude or toxic to community members
3.1.1.1 Breakdown
3.1.1.1.1 This is a catch-all misbehavior for any cases of rudeness, such as creating unnecessary drama, manipulation of others, being overly judgmental or critical of others, mocking members, pinging members after hours, pinging members when they ask not to be pinged etc. This should be used if a more specific form of rudeness is not already a rule.
3.1.1.1.2 Note that you can also receive strikes in meta misbehaviors as needed.
3.1.1.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.1.1.2.1 Technically, if you wanted to be overly concise, every rule could be boiled down to this. Just about every other misbehavior is either rude to community members directly, or by making the server a more unpleasant place to be, or rude to staff by making them do more work than needed. Of course, having a single extremely vague rule to cover everything goes against the above moderation and rule-creation philosophies. That said, a catch-all rule is needed, or else we’d be creating new rules forever.
3.1.1.2.2 As a catch all rule for rude behavior, it is categorized as a minor misbehavior, and follows the minor track for punishments.

3.1.2 Conduct detrimental to RSC
3.1.2.1 Breakdown
3.1.2.1.1 This refers to behavior that makes RSC unwelcoming to newcomers or look bad to outsiders. This is a catch-all for a variety of behavior. It is similar to rules in the Meta category in that it frequently occurs along with other behavior rules, but also often stands on its own.
3.1.2.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.1.2.2.1 This rule is categorized as a normal offense and follows the normal track for punishments.

3.1.3 Abusing members of the community
3.1.3.1 Breakdown
3.1.3.1.1 This refers to harassment of or threatening of other players or staff, including, but not limited to: verbal insults, text insults, and repeated, overt sarcastic responses in both text or voice chat. This can include DMs brought to the attention of the moderators. Generally only repeated cases of three or more, or severe single incidents, should be logged as this. Each case thereafter should result in a separate strike (assuming a punishment happened in-between). One-offs or two-offs that are minor should be marked down as general disrespect.
3.1.3.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.1.3.2.1 Moderators are looking for targeting. After a few repeated cases, consistent rudeness crosses into the line of being abusive, and is seen as a more serious occurrence.
3.1.3.2.2 As this is more serious than simple rudeness, it is categorized as a normal offense and follows the normal track for punishments.

3.1.4 Retaliating against staff or members
3.1.4.1 Breakdown
3.1.4.1.1 Retaliating against staff or members through RSC text channels or through direct messages that are brought to the attention of staff. ​
Evidence required.​
3.1.4.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.1.4.2.1 Members should feel free to come to staff with issues that arise. Sometimes action needs to be taken against members because of issues brought forth. No member of the community should be afraid that they will be targeted or retaliated against for bringing forth a concern. Likewise, no staff member should fear this either for doing their job. For example, if a player is being harassed and goes to moderators, the moderators take action, and the punished player attacks the original player for going to the moderators, they would receive a retaliating strike.
3.1.4.2.2 This is a very serious offense. No one should fear going to staff, and staff shouldn’t fear doing their job. This is categorized as a serious offense and follows the serious punishment track.

3.1.5 Explicit Conversations
3.1.5.1 Breakdown
3.1.5.1.1 Conversations referring to a topic that might make a movie rated R.
3.1.5.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.1.5.2.1 Many of us in RSC are adults. Many of us are not. Additionally, very few of us come to a Rocket League Discord in order to hear random rated-R tales from other people. While the server is not child-friendly, there is near-zero reason for these topics to be discussed.
3.1.5.2.2 Given that the line between appropriate conversations and conversations forbidden by this rule can be fuzzy, this rule is categorized as minor.

3.1.6 NSFW images or descriptions
3.1.6.1 Breakdown
3.1.6.1.1 Posting any images or descriptions that are considered not safe for work (NSFW) or other public locations due to nudity, sexual content, gore, extreme violence, or other aspects. Violations of this rule incur a normal strike. Drastically or overtly explicit materials will incur a serious strike.
3.1.6.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.1.6.2.1 Like with explicit conversations, there’s little reason to have any of this in RSC. There is a high likelihood of driving people away if enough of this were to be present.

3.1.7 Excessively spamming text chat with text or reactions
3.1.7.1 Breakdown
3.1.7.1.1 Any case of having five or more copies of a message, or of similar messages, within a short period of time in RSC is spam. If the message is particularly long or large (such as a large image), three or more cases is the limit. Similar things, like chains of memes, may be counted as spam. This also applies to in-game chat (The counts are per-game) for games played with RSC members. In all these cases, spam does not have to be by a single member; the message(s) that lead to the rule-break are punished.
3.1.7.1.2 Exceptions may be granted if it is highly likely that Discord problems may be causing the duplicates to occur, or if it appears to the user that they only appear once. This is a case where a user should DM the mod who assigned the consequences in order to reverse the consequences.
3.1.7.1.3 This also includes spamming of reactions to any messages.
3.1.7.1.4 Additionally, it is not spam if you are following the expected format of certain channels with consistent post formats.
3.1.7.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.1.7.2.1 We want our members to enjoy themselves and feel free to joke and meme, but spamming them is ignorant of those outside of the immediate group discussing as it clogs the channel with repeat messages.

3.1.8 Spamming voice chat/spam joining voice
3.1.8.1 Breakdown
3.1.8.1.1 Repeatedly joining and leaving voice chats 5 or more times in one minute.​ Switching between several voice chats counts for this.
3.1.8.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.1.8.2.1 This can be enormously irritating to any members currently in the call, and can cause lag within the server if done rapidly enough.

3.1.9 Posting scam/spam links
3.1.9.1 Breakdown
3.1.9.1.1 Any posting of links to harmful sites or repeated posting of links (i.e. other discord links). If evidence indicates malicious intent, this is instantly elevated to a ban.
3.1.9.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.1.9.2.1 We want all members to be able to post links to sites if they feel it relevant to a discussion or would like to advertise other streams/discord (as long as they have approval to post in the #advertising-and-events channel), and we want our members to be able to follow these links. If these links are repeatedly spammed, others who wish to advertise will find their links buried. In addition, the posting of highly unsafe links poses a threat to our community.

3.1.10 Swearing directed at another member
3.1.10.1 Breakdown
3.1.10.1.1 Foul language directed at another member/group. Slurs or bigoted speech falls under “Using slurs or bigoted speech”. Repeated cases of offensive language directed at others may incur additional strikes in abusing members of the community, or excessive spamming of text chat.
3.1.10.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.1.10.2.1 As the rule name implies, foul language should be avoided in an all-inclusive audience that includes children, especially when directed at other members.

3.1.11 Using slurs or bigoted speech
3.1.11.1 Breakdown
3.1.12.1.1 Using highly offensive language (e.g. slurs), whether directed at members or not.
3.1.11.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.1.11.2.1 RSC does not tolerate discrimination, and will strictly punish language that insults others. This will incur additional strikes if used directly at members. As a result of the highly offensive content that breaks this rule, breaking this rule will result in a serious strike

3.1.12 Impersonating members or staff
3.1.12.1 Breakdown
3.1.12.1.1 Any attempt to assume the role of another member or staff. This includes staff members, committee roles, or other elevated roles.
3.1.12.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.1.12.2.1 We view this transgression seriously. Staff members are trusted members within our community that can be looked to to reliably answer questions or ensure the safety and enjoyment of our members. Those who falsely assume that responsibility and abuse the trust of our members tarnish our reputation. This is not something to joke around about.

3.1.13 Known trade scamming
3.1.13.1 Breakdown
3.1.13.1.1 Intentionally misleading or outright lying to members in a trade, or attempted trade, with intention to scam the other member of one or more items.
3.1.13.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.1.13.2.1 RLTrader is used for any member entering our discord. For those who have been flagged as ‘scammers’ by RLTrader, or if they are positively identified as scammers in another way, a lifetime Trade Ban will be immediately levied. If they circumvent this ban by conducting a trade, they will be banned.

3.1.14 Breaking Rocket League TOS
3.1.14.1 Breakdown
3.1.14.1.1 Violating Anything outlined in the Terms of Service for Rocket League by Psyonix. This includes, but is not limited to, offering boosting services.
3.1.14.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.1.14.2.1 This is put in place as a major precaution in ensuring positive relations between RSC and Psyonix. In the event we attract the ire of Psyonix for allowing the TOS to be broken on our discord, our league can be shut down for good.

3.1.15 Misuse of channels
3.1.15.1 Breakdown
3.1.15.1.1 Anytime in which a member or members attempt to start a conversation in an inappropriate channel. This includes existing on-topic discussions that veer off-topic. This rule also includes any posting in the #serious-suggestion channel that is deemed not serious (which will incur strikes in Discussing suggestions or RSC updates without reading). This may only incur strikes after a member or staff has pointed out the appropriate channel.
3.1.15.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.1.15.2.1 We set up our Discord in such a way that our text channels may be used for specific discussions or posts, and we want our members to be able to use them to find the appropriate discussions. When pointing out that the conversation is considered off-topic for the channel it is in, please indicate the proper channel for the conversation to continue.

3.1.16 Lying to staff
3.1.16.1 Breakdown
3.1.16.1.1 Any instance in which a member is found to have lied to any staff member. This includes, but is not limited to, intentionally revealing false information, or false proof used to make accusations.
3.1.16.1.2 Any confirmed reports where members have attempted to hide information from staff members. This includes deleting messages in chat, and denying their existence or lying about the content in said messages.
3.1.16.1.3 Expect multiple strikes for complex or long-term ongoing lies.
3.1.16.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.1.16.2.1 Trust between RSC members and staff is incredibly important. Breaking this trust is a major issue, especially if major or repeated.

3.1.17 False accusations of serious offence
3.1.17.1 Breakdown
3.1.17.1.1 False or intentionally inaccurate accusations toward a member of any offence that has serious consequences, or accusations made without any real intent to investigate or prove.
3.1.17.1.2 Accusations of serious offenses include, but are not limited to, any form of cheating, abusing elevated roles, or other major misbehaviors.
3.1.17.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.1.17.2.1 We take any suspected infractions seriously, and do not want our staff’s time to be wasted investigating reports that were ultimately founded on poor humor, or dishonesty from the reporting party. If you do wish to make a serious complaint or accusation, please reach out to an Admin, the Mod Committee Head or use ModMail.

3.1.18 False accusations of serious offence towards staff
3.1.18.1 Breakdown
3.1.18.1.1 Falsely or intentionally inaccurate accusations of any offence toward a member of staff that has serious consequences, or accusations made without any real intent to investigate or prove.
3.1.18.1.2 Accusations of serious offenses include, but are not limited to, any form of cheating, abusing elevated roles, or other major misbehaviors.
3.1.18.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.1.18.2.1 Similar to false accusation of serious offence, however, because RSC expects staff members to be trusted members, and accusations can erode that trust, and lead to harsh consequences including removal for staff, RSC treats false accusations towards its staff members are a serious offense. We do understand that trust is earned, and if you have legitimate proof of staff members committing serious offences, we have methods of coming forward, be it through contacting an Admin, the Mod Committee Head or through Modmail.

3.1.19 Serious (death/assault) threats
3.1.19.1 Breakdown
3.1.19.1.1 Any threat that involves serious harm to another member, jokingly or not.
3.1.19.1.2 The mentioning of suicide also falls under this category and will incur two strikes.
3.1.19.1.3 If the threat is apparently serious, has evidence to suggest serious intent, or is paired with ongoing harassment, three strikes are applied.
3.1.19.1.4 Memes and comments directed at no one that fall under this category may be marked as a regular serious offense. However this is at mod discretion, and context may not always be understood.
3.1.19.2 Explanation and Thoughts
3.1.19.2.1 This rule was put into place as we have built a community of members who strive to enjoy their time here,and to have fun with other RSC members. In ensuring a warm atmosphere, death threats will not be tolerated, joking or not, and will incur a sharp and swift punishment. Suicide is no joking matter and threats of it in any fashion are unacceptable, and will be treated as such. Mods may use discretion in handing out punishments.

3.1.20 Non-English text in chat
3.1.20.1 Breakdown
3.1.20.1.1 Any repeated use of non-English text in any of our text chats.
3.1.20.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.1.20.2.1 We run our Discord using English, and as a result, all official interactions from league staff are expected to comply. Our staff only universally knows English, and therefore cannot be expected to understand or work with non-English messages. We certainly don’t want to discriminate against players simply for knowing a different language than English; however, the overwhelming majority of our members converse exclusively in English. If a moderator can translate the text and finds it to break any other rules, strikes will be applied accordingly.

### 3.2 RSC Championship & Other Event Misbehaviors

3.2.1 Throwing a match or fixing matches
3.2.1.1 Breakdown
3.2.1.1.1 Any discovered attempts at changing the outcome of a game. This can include throwing games, or arranging for other members to fix matches in any fashion.
3.2.1.1.2 This infraction does not reset with the forgiveness cycle.
3.2.1.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.2.1.2.1 RSC does not tolerate cheating of any kind. We strive to be a league where our members can push themselves and their teammates to be the best in their skill tier every season, and talent should be the biggest role in crowning champions each season.

3.2.2 Rage quitting
3.2.2.1 Breakdown
3.2.2.1.1 Defined as leaving an RSC league match prior to the official end of the match. This includes leaving a match before the game clock has reached zero seconds, but the ball has not hit the ground. If your name and score do not show up on the post-game lobby scoreboard, you will have been found to be in violation of this rule.
3.2.2.1.2 Players GM will be notified of this behavior.
3.2.2.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.2.2.2.1 RSC is meant to be a fun and competitive atmosphere for all our members. Losing a match can often be frustrating, but good sportsmanship dictates playing a match to its conclusion, and hopefully congratulating the other team (win or lose) on their good games. In addition to this, our stats managers use the screenshots uploaded after the games to update player and team stats, and not having the name on the screenshot adds more time and work to a group that has to handle uploading several games a night.

3.2.3 Falsely/incorrectly reporting scores
3.2.3.1 Breakdown
3.2.3.1.1 Inaccurate reporting of scores or replays in the #score-reporting channel. Also includes intentionally or repeatedly incorrect uploading of replays and screenshots to the website.
3.2.3.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.2.3.2.1 We want our league to run on accurate information. Ensuring gms that players know how to upload and report scores is a responsibility shared by player, staff, and GMs. As mentioned above, our stats managers have to read and upload hundreds of players’ info each game, and if those reporting it are either intentionally making their job harder, or just refusing to learn how to properly submit things, they will be punished. Additionally, we want the player’s GM to know as it is also their responsibility to ensure their players understand how to accurately report and upload that information.

3.2.4 Other cheating
3.2.4.1 Breakdown
3.2.4.1.1 Any intentional breaking of league rules not specifically outlined in the previous rules. This includes discovered smurfing (with proof and multiple witnesses) or other acts of intentionally misrepresenting information to the league.
3.2.4.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.2.4.2.1 RSC is intended to be fun for all skill levels, and we have gone to considerable lengths to ensure as much balance as possible in RSCC matches (i.e. keeping grand champs from playing in a tier filled with platinum players). To that end, if players are discovered to have hidden account information or provided false information in an effort to change their placement within the league, or even within tiers, severe penalties will be levied. When supplying account information to the league, be sure to include ones you don’t play often. For example, a grand champ can have a separate account that may be gold or platinum to play with lower-ranked friends, however, if they only provide the lower-levelled account and are placed accordingly into a tier, there would be severe consequences for hiding the other account.

3.2.5 Leaving the server while mid-event (including RSCC)
3.2.5.1 Breakdown
3.2.5.1.1 Defined as any member leaving the RSC discord in the middle of any RSC/RSCC-sponsored event.
3.2.5.1.2 This infraction does not reset with the forgiveness cycle.
3.2.5.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.2.5.2.1 This entails an immediate removal from the event and the next instance of it, and in the event of the member being in RSCC, a 2 season-long ban being enforced. Our members have to be in this discord to stay informed of all relevant announcements and discussions, and it is much more difficult to stay up-to-date if not in the server. Some consideration will be given if proof is given of mechanical error, as there has been a report of someone being forcibly removed from all discord servers at one moment.

3.2.6 Using non-matching in-game names during RSCC matches
3.2.6.1 Breakdown
3.2.6.1.1 Defined as any RSCC player using an in-game name that does not match the name assigned to them in the RSC Discord
3.2.6.2 Explanation and Thoughts
3.2.6.2.1 Stats Committee already puts in an extended amount of work to accurately compile stats across all tiers of RSCC. Players have been asked to ensure that their in-game names match their Discord names on file, and have been given multiple opportunities and resources to do so.

### 3.3 Mention/Ping Misbehaviors

3.3.1 Misusing group pings
3.3.1.1 Breakdown
3.3.1.1.1 Defined as either pointless use of group pings, or use of ping roles for invalid reasons.
3.3.1.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.3.1.2.1 In addition to the ability to ping group rules being highly restricted, improper use of group pings can be frustrating and time-consuming for the affected groups.

3.3.2 Pinging a staff role as a joke
3.3.2.1 Breakdown
3.3.2.1.1 Defined as pings directed at staff roles with no legitimate reason, or no context to explain the purpose of the ping.
3.3.2.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.3.2.2.1 Similar to “Misusing group pings,” our staff roles cannot be pinged without proper reason. If this happens repeatedly, staff members may begin to ignore them, and as a result be delayed in responding to more serious situations.

3.3.3 Pinging @everyone
3.3.3.1 Breakdown
3.3.3.2 Defined as the successful use of an @everyone ping.
3.3.3.2 Explanation and Thoughts
3.3.3.2.1 Pinging @everyone is separate from the other roles, and faces more severe consequences as a warning will pop up before you confirm you want to do it.

### 3.4 Forbidden Topic Misbehaviors

3.4.1 Spoiling recent media
3.4.1.1 Breakdown
3.4.1.1.1 Defined as intentionally revealing information about recent media (shows, movies, etc. that have come out within a month) that can spoil the enjoyment of members who are interested in that media, but have not been able to see it yet.
3.4.1.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.4.1.2.1 Spoilers are no fun for those affected, and we want our members to act in good faith in ensuring that they make reasonable efforts to avoid revealing critical information.

3.4.2 Discussing politics, religion, or other serious real-life topics in bad faith or an offensive manner
3.4.2.1 Breakdown
3.4.2.1.1 Discussions regarding politics, religion, or other controversial or otherwise serious real-life topics in bad faith or an offensive manner. “In bad faith” refers to having an intent to deceive others or refusing to confront facts or choices. Attacking others in conversations related to these topics will likely receive strikes here and in other categories.
3.4.2.1.2 Moderators reserve the right to block certain topics from being discussed for a period of time if they believe it to be causing too much drama. Continuing to discuss prohibited topics will result in at minimum one strike being applied to this rule, in addition to a strike being applied in “Testing or baiting mods”, per admin discretion.
3.4.2.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.4.2.2.1 While we wish for our members to be able to engage in discourse about these topics in a calm or mature manner, overtly aggressive discussions on controversial subjects or hostile behavior regarding these discussions verges on offensive behavior or discriminatory acts Infractions in this section are highly likely to incur strikes in “Using slurs or bigoted speech”, “Abusing others”, or “Being generally disrespectful, rude or toxic to community members”. Discussing these in RSC is a privilege, and if our members cannot conduct themselves in a composed manner, RSC may see fit to revoke the ability to discuss these topics in an effort to ensure everyone feels safe and welcome.
3.4.2.2.2 If a moderator feels that the discussion of certain topics has been repeatedly toxic or otherwise non-conforming to the behavior rules, we will block the discussion of the topic(s) to preserve the integrity and atmosphere of the discord.

### 3.5 Meta Misbehaviors

3.5.1 Asking for specific punishments for yourself or another
3.5.1.1 Breakdown
3.5.1.1.1 Defined as attempts for mods or other members of staff to levy punishment against themselves or other community members. More strikes may be incurred if action is demanded against staff members.
3.5.1.1.2 At the option of the staff, you may instead receive exactly what you asked for, applied to you, and additional strikes may be incurred in “Testing or baiting mods”.
3.5.1.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.5.1.2.1 We have rules and punishments outlined in these guidelines that we will use, without exception, when deemed necessary by relevant staff members . Demanding the staff levy a harsher punishment than what was given will also fall under this category. We do not mean to discourage our members from reporting suspected rule breaks (which can be done by contacting the Mod Committee Head, using the modmail bot or contacting an Admin), and we will never punish community members who submit complaints in good faith, However, asking or demanding punishment goes beyond reporting the issue.

3.5.2 Testing or baiting mods
3.5.2.1 Breakdown
3.5.2.1.1 Defined as any attempt to get negative reactions from moderators or trying to “bait” mods into levying punishments.
3.5.2.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.5.2.2.1 Similar to asking for specific punishments for yourself or another, our moderators are hardworking members of our community who have agreed to ensure that all members stay within the rules to ensure a fun and inviting atmosphere, and it is important to not take their roles lightly. Attempts to elicit negative reactions or any administrative response are considered to be disrespectful of the time these members have put into the community, and will be punished accordingly. Strikes may be incurred in other areas such as “Abusing others” and “Baiting other community members” if deemed necessary.

3.5.3 Baiting other community members
3.5.3.1 Breakdown
3.5.3.1.1 Defined as any attempt to elicit a negative reaction or any attempt to push other community members into reacting in ways that could be punished.
3.5.3.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.5.3.2.1 Similar to “Testing or Baiting Mods”, this rule can be ultimately condensed to “button-pushing”. Repeated attempts to bring up topics that can aggravate other members, or making remarks that hope to draw out a stronger, more negative response from the other members, but stop short of full-on derogatory remarks.

3.5.4 Attempting to bypass punishments
3.5.4.1 Breakdown
3.5.4.1.1 Defined as any attempts to subvert existing punishments or to prevent infractions being reported and punished. Includes the use of alternate accounts, or deleting content in an attempt to hide it from mods.
3.5.4.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.5.4.2.1 We take the integrity of our rules seriously, and any attempts to commit infractions and prevents its detection will be viewed as a serious offence. This category can incur strikes with any other misbehaviors.

3.5.5 Attempting to time misbehaviors to minimize punishments
3.5.5.1 Breakdown
3.5.5.1.1 Any revealed attempts to time potential misbehaviors in such a way as to minimize punishments.
3.5.5.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.5.5.2.1 Similar to attempting to bypass punishments, this rule will always incur strikes in separate categories, and is broken when it is revealed the member has timed their offense to limit the maximum punishment that may be levied. This includes waiting until the Forgiveness Period has been reached and strikes have been reduced to avoid more serious consequences.

3.5.6 Encouraging drama or rule-breaking, or promising to do so
3.5.6.1 Breakdown
3.5.6.1.1 Any discovered attempts to encourage or bait other members into committing offences, or statements confirming intent to do so. If two or more members are found to have been working together encouraging others to violate rules, they may incur strikes in “Collaborating to commit misbehaviors”.
3.5.6.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.5.6.2.1 This is another catch-all category for behaviors that are intended to blatantly encourage members to break rules, or behaviors that show premeditated efforts to commit a misbehavior. This will incur additional strikes in the area in which the member was promising to break, and/or the rules in which the member was encouraging others to break.

3.5.7 Collaborating to commit misbehaviors
3.5.7.1 Breakdown
3.5.7.1.1 Any confirmed efforts to work together to commit misbehaviors. The consequences in this area are applied to all applicable members involved who have been shown to actively participate in preparing for the infraction(s).
3.5.7.1.2 This does not refer to members who merely do the same misbehavior in close succession or otherwise, but only those who are intending to work together.
3.5.7.2 Explanation And Thoughts
3.5.7.2.1 This rule was intended to punish members who actively participate in groups to create discord in our Discord, and comes with steep consequences, the doubling of strikes received for any misbehaviors committed.

### 3.6 RSC 6mans/4mans Misbehaviors

3.6.1 Upon receiving a sufficient report of toxicity in the RSC 6mans/4mans queues, players will be given an initial warning.
3.6.2 After a second report, the player will be removed from the all applicable 6mans/4mans queues for one week.
3.6.3 After a third report, the player will be permanently removed from all applicable 6mans/4mans queues.
3.6.3.1 This removal is not appealable.
3.6.4 The Moderation Committee reserves the right to skip any of these steps depending on the severity of the misbehavior.

## 4 GM-Specific And Staff-Specific Rules

### 4.1 GM Misbehaviors

4.1.1 Abusing player trust
4.1.1.1 Breakdown
4.1.1.1.1 Taking actions that take advantage of the trust that players place in GMs, purposefully making use of that trust in a way that is against player desires or expectations. Alternatively, choosing to not take action in a way that produces these results.
4.1.1.2 Explanation And Thoughts
4.1.1.2.1 This is a fairly serious concern. If there is zero doubt that a GM was trying to take advantage of a player’s trust, and the actions were not in favor of the player, it is likely that the GM may skip forward several consequence stages.

4.1.2 Misleading players
4.1.2.1 Breakdown
4.1.2.1.1 Taking actions that result in misleading or confusing players through accident, ignorance, or apathy. Alternatively, producing these results through failing to take expected actions.
4.1.2.2 Explanation And Thoughts
4.1.2.2.1 The key difference between this and abusing player trust is the intention of the GM, to the best of the ability of the staff to determine. There is an important difference between a GM who is poor at communication, and a GM who is purposefully misinforming.

4.1.3 Failing to respond to player concerns
4.1.3.1 Breakdown
4.1.3.1.1 Not taking action when a player presents concerns, taking clearly insufficient action, or failing to communicate with the player regardless of how the concerns are dealt with.
4.1.3.2 Explanation And Thoughts
4.1.3.2.1 A GM who fails to respond to player concerns is one that will soon have a franchise that is collapsing under the weight of its own problems.

4.1.4 Breaking other GM guidelines
4.1.4.1 Breakdown
4.1.4.1.1 Blatantly going against the guidelines for GMs given in the GM Handbook or other official references.
4.1.4.2 Explanation And Thoughts
4.1.4.2.1 The GM Handbook is an always-improving guide to being a GM. It is something worth reading for all GMs.

4.1.5 Committing misbehaviors in the Meta category
4.1.5.1 Breakdown
4.1.5.1.1 Receiving strikes for misbehaviors in the Meta category.
4.1.5.2 Explanation And Thoughts
4.1.5.2.1 The misbehaviors in the Meta category are typically one of multiple rules broken at a time. Moreover, they tend to indicate clear disrespect towards staff or the structure of RSC. Those who break these rules are usually indicating that they are not fit to be a General Manager.

4.1.6 Committing other misbehaviors
4.1.6.1 Breakdown
4.1.6.1.1 Receiving strikes for misbehaviors outside of the Meta category.
4.1.6.2 Explanation And Thoughts
4.1.6.2.1 General Managers should serve as representatives of RSC to newcomers and long-time players alike. If they are breaking RSC behavior rules, they are setting a poor example for others, who will likely follow the lead of the GMs.

4.1.7 Toxic/unpleasant team Discord
4.1.7.1 Breakdown
4.1.7.1.1 Having a team/franchise Discord that regularly is the source of complaints or that is causing players to have a poor experience.
4.1.7.2 Explanation And Thoughts
4.1.7.2.1 Team/franchise Discord servers are generally moderated only by the GM and those they select. They set their own rules, however, general respect and a zero tolerance on discrimination is expected to be enforced by the GM.

### 4.2 Staff Misbehaviors

4.2.1 Abusing player trust
4.2.1.1 Breakdown
4.2.1.1.1 Taking actions that take advantage of the trust that players place in staff, purposefully making use of that trust in a way that is against player desires or expectations. Alternatively, choosing to not take action in a way that produces these results.
4.2.1.2 Explanation And Thoughts
4.2.1.2.1 This is a fairly serious concern. If there is zero doubt that a staff member was trying to take advantage of a player’s trust, and the actions were not in the favor of the player, it is likely that the staff member may skip forward several consequence stages.

4.2.2 Misleading players
4.2.2.1 Breakdown
4.2.2.1.1 Taking actions that result in misleading or confusing players through accident, ignorance, or apathy. Alternatively, producing these results through failing to take expected actions.
4.2.2.2 Explanation And Thoughts
4.2.2.2.1 The key difference between this and abusing player trust is the intention of the staff member, to the best of the ability of the staff to determine. There is an important difference between a staff member who is poor at communication, and a staff member who is purposefully misinforming

4.2.3 Failing to respond to player/GM concerns
4.2.3.1 Breakdown
4.2.3.1.1 Not taking action when a player or GM presents concerns, taking clearly insufficient action, or failing to communicate with the player/GM regardless of how the concerns are dealt with.
4.2.3.2 Explanation And Thoughts
4.2.3.2.1 One of the key roles of being a staff member is to listen and act upon concerns from players and GM's. By not doing so or by not doing enough, the staff member is failing in representing their position as part of RSC staff.

4.2.4 Breaking other staff guidelines
4.2.4.1 Breakdown
4.2.4.1.1 Blatantly going against the guidelines for staff given in the Staff Handbook or other official references.
4.2.4.2 Explanation And Thoughts
4.2.4.2.1 The Staff Handbook is an always-improving guide to being a staff member. It is expected that all members of staff have read and understand these guidelines.

4.2.5 Committing misbehaviors in the Meta category
4.2.5.1 Breakdown
4.2.5.1.1 Receiving strikes for misbehaviors inside of the Meta category.
4.2.5.2 Explanation And Thoughts
4.2.5.2.1 The misbehaviors in the Meta category are typically one of multiple rules broken at a time. Moreover, they tend to indicate clear disrespect towards the structure of RSC. Those who break these rules are usually indicating that they are not fit to be a staff member

4.2.6 Committing other misbehaviors
4.2.6.1 Breakdown
4.2.6.1.1 Receiving strikes for misbehaviors outside of the Meta category.
4.2.6.2 Explanation And Thoughts
4.2.6.2.1 The misbehaviors in the Meta category are typically one of multiple rules broken at a time. Moreover, they tend to indicate clear disrespect towards the structure of RSC. Those who break these rules are usually indicating that they are not fit to be a staff member

### 4.3 GM And Staff Consequences

4.3.1 How GMs And Staff Members Are Punished
4.3.1.1 In addition to the regular behavior rules, to which GMs and staff will serve the same consequences as any other player, GMs and staff are held to follow the above rules. For breaking these rules, they have a different set of consequences applied that dictate whether or not they will keep their positions. The following stages are tracked separately if they have both GM and staff roles.
4.3.2 Stages
4.3.2.1 No Problem
4.3.2.1.1 The “zeroth” stage. At this point, there are no real issues, or they have been handled.
4.3.2.2 Minor Discussion - a single potentially serious issue or concern; several rather minor problems
4.3.2.2.1 The first stage. This leads to a single discussion during a between-season (referring to RSCC seasons) meeting, and perhaps one additional discussion. It is very easy for an individual to reach this stage, and so is considered fairly minor.
4.3.2.2.2 If this meeting is missed, it can be rescheduled. Repeatedly putting it off, however, may lead to the next stage.
4.3.2.3 Monthly Check-In - a somewhat serious concern; frequently recurring minor problems or reports
4.3.2.3.1 The second stage. This requires a monthly check-in with a member of staff or an admin, going over the events of the past month in some detail, with a focus on ensuring the problems that led to this stage are not repeated.
4.3.2.3.2 If a meeting or discussion is missed without warning or not promptly rescheduled after notice of a missed meeting is given, the individual will move to the next stage.
4.3.2.4 Weekly Check-In - a very serious problem; repeat serious concerns or report; constantly recurring minor to major problems or reports
4.3.2.4.1 The third stage. This requires a weekly check-in with a member of staff of an admin, going over the events of the past week in considerable detail, with a focus on ensuring the problems that led to this stage are not repeated. Reaching this stage as either a staff member or GM will increase their stage by one in the other track.
4.3.2.4.2 If a meeting or discussion is missed without warning or not promptly rescheduled after notice of a missed meeting is given, the individual will move to the next stage. This means that these meetings are critical to attend.
4.3.2.5 Dismissal
4.3.2.5.1 The fourth and final stage. The individual has their relevant roles removed. Reaching this stage as either a staff member or GM will increase their stage by one in the other track. The individual will not be considered for the same role again (barring rare admin exceptions).

## 5 RSC Moderation Details

### 5.1 Consequences

5.1.1 The full consequences for rules are outlined in the companion spreadsheet to this document, accessible here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QVhRl-guJvLkKRVoI8J0RpKJyVdvwFHySud8](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QVhRl-guJvLkKRVoI8J0RpKJyVdvwFHySud8eJv0a6c/edit#gid=806794239) [eJv0a6c/edit#gid=806794239](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QVhRl-guJvLkKRVoI8J0RpKJyVdvwFHySud8eJv0a6c/edit#gid=806794239)

5.1.2 Consequence Scale
5.1.2.1 Explanation
5.1.2.1.1 The behavior rules have been generally broken down into three categories, each with their own punishment scale. There are minor offenses, normal offenses and serious offenses.
5.1.2.1.2 Breaking the rules into three categories serves two purposes. It helps members have an easier time understanding the punishment scale, and an easier time knowing where they stand in terms of each scale.
5.1.2.1.3 Certain infractions may carry strikes in multiple scales. For example, using a slur while baiting a mod could receive a serious and normal strikes simultaneously. Additionally, certain actions may lead to the doubling of strikes, as outlined in the guidelines.
5.1.2.2 Minor Offenses
5.1.2.2.1 This category is for the rules that are seen as relatively minor compared to the others, and deserving of more leniency.
5.1.2.2.2 The minor punishment scale allows for 7 strikes, with upscaling consequences before the mod committee will consider a ban upon the 8th strike.
5.1.2.3 Normal Offenses
5.1.2.3.1 This category allows for 4 strikes, with upscaling consequences before the mod committee will consider a ban upon the 5th strike.
5.1.2.4 Serious Offenses
5.1.2.4.1 The highest category, the rules here are very serious, and carry steep consequences.
5.1.2.4.2 Only two strikes will be allowed, and a subsequent strike will result in the mod committee considering a ban.

5.1.3 General Types Of Consequences
5.1.3.1 Warning
5.1.3.1.1 A simple warning.
5.1.3.2 Timeout
5.1.3.2.1 A period of time during which an individual cannot type or talk in RSC.
5.1.3.2.2 This is considered relatively minor; if assigned consequences are brought into question, a timeout will not be ended until a final decision is rendered.
5.1.3.3 Match And Event Suspension
5.1.3.3.1 A suspension from a single regular season match in any RSC league and a suspension from a single non-league event.
5.1.3.3.2 If the individual is participating in multiple leagues within RSC, then the next match is the one they are suspended from. Likewise, the next event is what they are suspended from, regardless of their intent to join it. (Community Nights do not count as events.)
5.1.3.3.3 If the individual is not participating in any leagues within RSC, then the match suspensions do not apply.
5.1.3.3.4 Any game in which a suspended individual plays is counted as a forfeit. This can also lead to additional consequences for the suspended individual.
5.1.3.3.5 This is considered relatively major; if assigned consequences are brought into question, individuals will not be required to serve suspensions until a final decision is rendered. Forfeits that are earned from ignoring suspensions will not be undone, however.
5.1.3.4 Ban
5.1.3.4.1 A ban from the Discord server and other RSC-controlled locations.
5.1.3.5 Channel Ban
5.1.3.5.1 A ban from some specific channel or group of channels in the Discord.
5.1.3.5.2 Attempting to move conversation that is meant to be put in that channel into another channel will be met with consequences.
5.1.3.6 Event Removal
5.1.3.6.1 Being removed from a current instance of an RSC event, the next one, or all future ones.

5.1.4 General Consequences
5.1.4.1 Warning: Written warning + optional 5 minute timeout
5.1.4.2 Short Timeout: 30 minute timeout
5.1.4.3 Standard Timeout: 1 hour timeout
5.1.4.4 Long Timeout: 24 hour timeout
5.1.4.5 Extended Timeout: 3 day timeout
5.1.4.6 Severe Timeout: 7 day timeout
5.1.4.7 Season Timeout: 7 day timeout, suspended from all matches and events until the end of the current season (or the following season, if it is within 7 days of playoffs or later)
5.1.4.8 Enforced Break: 14 day timeout
5.1.4.9 Ban: Indefinite ban from all RSC platforms
5.1.4.10 Suspension: Suspended from playing in a specified number of match days,

5.1.5 Special Case Consequences
5.1.5.1 Trade Ban: Banned from the trade channel indefinitely
5.1.5.2 Suggestion Ban: Banned from posting to #serious-suggestions and other RSC serious discussion channels until the end of the current season
5.1.5.3 Removed From Event: Removed from the relevant event and the next instance of it
5.1.5.4 RSC Event Ban: Indefinite ban from all RSC events (RSCC, tournaments, etc.)

5.1.6 Consequence Breakdown
5.1.6.1 Warning: Written warning + optional 5 minute timeout
5.1.6.1.1 This is a simple warning, delivered in the text chat, DMs or via RSC Red through DMs. However, a bot-based warning should always be delivered eventually (even if the initial warning was just given by a moderator in chat) in order to record the event.
5.1.6.1.2 Do not give warnings outside of the detailed consequence structure. If an infraction should get a warning first, the rule’s consequences will have a warning listed.
5.1.6.1.3 The optional 5 minute timeout should be given in cases where the member is actively continuing to break a rule (that is, if you are interrupting a string of misbehaviors) or if a situation seems particularly heated. Once the member has received a warning, with or without the timeout, if they continue, then they should receive another strike rather than having the 5 minutes added or getting another warning.
5.1.6.2 Short Timeout: 30 minute timeout, max. 0 suspensions
5.1.6.2.1 This is often given as effectively a more severe warning, as a step leading towards greater consequences.
5.1.6.2.2 Note that it can never lead to an individual being blocked from an event or portion of an event.
5.1.6.3 Standard Timeout: 1 hour timeout
5.1.6.3.1 A basic timeout of noticeable length. May be used as an extremely severe warning.
5.1.6.3.2 If this overlaps with the official start time of an event, it can block the individual from participating in that event. (For simplicity, only the start time is used; if they are punished in the middle of an event, they are not removed from the event. Certain misbehaviors may have exceptions to this.)
5.1.6.4 Long Timeout: 24 hour timeout
5.1.6.4.1 A timeout of one full day. Occasionally used as a warning-equivalent for some very severe misbehaviors.
5.1.6.4.2 If this overlaps with the official start time of an event, it can block the individual from participating in that event. (For simplicity, only the start time is used; if they are punished in the middle of an event, they are not removed from the event. Certain misbehaviors may have exceptions to this.)
5.1.6.5 Extended Timeout: 3 day timeout, min. 1 match and event suspension
5.1.6.5.1 A strong consequence. Severe misbehaviors that directly affect event operations may begin with this as a first step.
5.1.6.5.2 If this overlaps with the official start time of an event, it can block the individual from participating in that event. (For simplicity, only the start time is used; if they are punished in the middle of an event, they are not removed from the event. Certain misbehaviors may have exceptions to this.) Regardless of whether or not it overlaps, the individual is definitely blocked from the next league match and the next non-league event that occur.
5.1.6.6 Severe Timeout: 7 day timeout, min. 2 match and event suspensions
5.1.6.6.1 A major consequence. Extremely severe misbehaviors that directly affect event operations may begin with this as a first step.
5.1.6.6.2 If this overlaps with the official start time of an event, it can block the individual from participating in that event. (For simplicity, only the start time is used; if they are punished in the middle of an event, they are not removed from the event. Certain misbehaviors may have exceptions to this.) Regardless of whether or not it overlaps, the individual is definitely blocked from the next two league matches and the next two non-league events that occur.
5.1.6.7 Season Timeout: 7 day timeout, suspended from all matches and events until the end of the current season (or the following season, if it is within 7 days of playoffs or later)
5.1.6.7.1 Consequences that essentially force the individual in question to take an extended break from all things RSC.
5.1.6.7.2 “Within 7 days of playoffs” is defined as up to seven days before the day on which the first RSCC playoff game occurs (in the tier that begins its playoffs first).
5.1.6.8 Enforced Break: 14 day timeout
5.1.6.8.1 An enforced break from RSC. For some rules, this is given instead of a ban for the seventh strike.
5.1.6.8.2 On the second enforced break, the individual should be considered for a ban.
5.1.6.8.3 If this overlaps with the official start time of an event, it can block the individual from participating in that event. (For simplicity, only the start time is used; if they are punished in the middle of an event, they are not removed from the event. Certain misbehaviors may have exceptions to this.)
5.1.6.9 Ban: Indefinite ban from all RSC platforms
5.1.6.9.1 A permanent ban from all RSC platforms. When an individual reaches this step, a ban is not guaranteed, as a discussion among moderation staff should always occur first. This is done because a ban cannot be easily undone - the individual may be impossible to contact after they are banned due to the nature of Discord.
5.1.6.9.2 When an individual is being considered for a ban, they will be placed on an enforced break. The staff has until the end of that two-week period to choose to assign or not assign a ban. If a ban is not given, the individual will serve out the remainder of the enforced break.
5.1.6.10 Trade Ban: Banned from the trade channel indefinitely
5.1.6.10.1 The individual is barred from posting to the trade channel. If the individual is seen to be attempting to get around the channel ban or otherwise is still causing related problems, they may be barred from viewing the channel at a moderator’s discretion.
5.1.6.11 Suggestion Ban: Banned from posting to #serious-suggestions and other RSC serious discussion channels until the end of the current season
5.1.6.11.1 The individual is barred from posting to #serious-suggestions and #serious-suggestion-discussion. If the individual is seen to be attempting to get around the channel ban or otherwise is still causing related problems, they may be barred from viewing the channel at a moderator’s discretion.
5.1.6.12 Removed From Event: Removed from the relevant event and the next instance of it
5.1.6.12.1 For leagues, this means that an individual is removed from the current season and banned from the following season as well. For non-league events, this means the current instance of the event as well as the following one.
5.1.6.13 RSC Event Ban: Indefinite ban from all RSC events (RSCC, tournaments, etc.)
5.1.6.13.1 You cannot participate in any current and future RSC events. Community Night is excluded from this.

### 5.2 Applying Punishments

5.2.1 Multi-Rule Breaking
5.2.1.1 If an individual breaks multiple rules at once, they receive strikes for each rule.
5.2.2 Multiple Strikes
5.2.2.1 If an individual commits an especially serious offense, they may receive two or more strikes for a single offense. Some rules have specific guidelines for this. Outside of these cases, this is up to moderator discretion. These cases should always be reviewed by other moderators. It is possible for some or all of the strikes to be overturned if the strikes were given unfairly.

### 5.3 GM Notifications

5.3.1 General Managers will receive notifications of a player receiving punishments. They will also be able to be informed of any significant misbehaviors for players they are interested in adding to the team.
5.3.1.1 General Managers will be granted the ability to look up any Free Agent players to determine if there are significant issues prior to signing them to a permanent or temporary contract.

### 5.4 Forgiveness Cycle

5.4.1 Forgiveness
5.4.1.1The day after the last RSC Final of the season at 12pm Eastern, all members will have their strike counts reduced by two in the Minor and Normal offence categories, and by one in the Serious offence category. Some misbehaviors are excluded from this, and their strikes do not decrease with time.
5.4.1.2 Within two weeks of the Forgiveness Cycle being applied, any infractions committed by a member who has strikes forgiven will receive an additional strike. At mod discretion, an additional 1 strike may also be applied in attempting to time misbehaviors to minimize punishments.
5.4.1.3 Suggestion Bans are lifted with the Forgiveness Cycle, regardless of the number of strikes remaining; they are reapplied if the appropriate number of strikes has been met or exceeded upon gaining another strike.
5.4.1.4 The Forgiveness Cycle starts at 12pm EST, not upon the sending of the DM notifying players that the Forgiveness Cycle has begun.

### 5.5 Channel Details

5.5.1 Off-Topic Conversations
5.5.1.1 By default, channels should have off-topic discussions directed to the appropriate channel, with consequences given if the conversation continues in that channel. Some channels should be handled more strictly.
5.5.1.2 The following channels should have any off-topic conversations deleted (with conversations screenshotted and placed in the appropriate channel, as is considered reasonable amounts of effort by the mod doing the deletion) in order to aid future readers: set-role, match-check-in, score-reporting, looking-for-scrim, serious-suggestions, member-streams, advertising-and-events, introductions, and faq. If the conversation immediately returns, then it counts as misuse of channels.

## 6 Appealing Moderator Actions And Requesting Moderator Reviews

### 6.1 What Is It?

6.1.1 Appealing moderator actions refers to going to a higher authority in RSC (than the individual moderator who took the actions in question) in order to have moderator actions partially or fully overturned.
6.1.2 Requesting a moderator review refers to asking a higher authority in RSC, usually the Arbiters to examine whether or not a moderator’s actions and behavior is in line with RSC’s views and the behavior rules and guidelines.

### 6.2 When To Do It?

6.2.1 You should appeal a moderator’s actions when you believe you did not commit one or more of the misbehaviors you were given consequences for, or if you believe the punishment was out of line or inconsistent with the current behavior rules and guidelines.
6.2.2 You should not do it if you simply disagree with the behavior rules and guidelines. Just because you think a rule should not exist does not give you the freedom to break it whenever and wherever you wish.
6.2.3 You should request a moderator review if you feel they acted rudely or otherwise inappropriately for a moderator and representative of RSC. You can also request a moderator review if you believe a moderator is clearly acting with bias towards or against some individual or group.
6.2.4 You should not request a moderator review if you have no reason beyond personally not liking the moderator or because another individual asked you to.

### 6.3 How To Do It?

6.3.1 You can appeal the actions of a moderator by contacting the Mod Committee Head and stating that you would like to appeal. Please specify what strike you were given that you’d like to appeal.
6.3.1.1 You must request an appeal of a strike within a week of said strike being applied.
6.3.2 The Mod Committee Head will be responsible for setting up the appeal channel in the RSC Appeals Server. One channel will outline relevant rules that apply in the case, as well as evidence. Another channel will be created so the member who is making the appeal can put forth their case for why they are appealing.​

### 6.4 Appeal Limits

6.4.1 Players will be allotted two appeals per season. This appeal limit will reset with the Forgiveness cycle each season.
6.4.2 The Mod Committee reserves the right to deny any player an appeal that is deemed abusive of the system or egregious in nature.
6.4.2.1 The Mod Committee must have a unanimous 7-0 vote in order to deny a player an appeal.​
​

### 6.5 What Can Happen?

The Arbiter Process is Outlined in the Arbiter Handbook, which can be found here: [RSC Arbiter Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XG6BFUme6q_81LjOsN9PxEyYMwnnyiOHCLqGJz7Zgec/edit)

## 7 New Player Behavior Period

### 7.1 What is it?

7.1.1 The New Player Behavior Period is a one week period after a member joins RSC for the first time where all offenses are grouped together in a point system, and the accrual of a certain number of points results in the possibility of a ban.

### 7.2 How Does it Work?

7.2.1 Any minor offences give the player a single point on their record.
7.2.2 Any normal offences give the player two points on their record.
7.2.3 Any serious offences give the player three points on their record.
7.2.4 The accrual of 5 points leaves the member open for a ban from the mod committee, regardless of where they stand on the regular punishment scales.

### 7.3 How Does This Interact With The Regular Punishment Scales?

7.3.1 The member will serve the regular punishments, and retain the strikes in addition to receiving points. The strikes may be subject to the Forgiveness Cycle as any other strike is.

### 7.4 What Happens When A New Player is Up For A Ban?

7.4.1 The member, upon reaching 5 total points, will be placed on enforced break.
7.4.2 The mod committee will examine the offences and have two weeks to determine if a ban is justified.
7.4.3 If the mod committee determines a ban is not justified, the player will still serve the appropriate punishment for the strike, and be placed back at 4 points, unless the first week has passed, in which case, the new player period is over.
7.4.4 If the two weeks has passed and the committee could not reach a decision, the player cannot be banned under the new player period, and the new player period will have passed.

## 8 Arbiter Clarifications

### 8.1 Purpose

8.1.1 The Purpose of this section is to explain when an arbiter decision clarifies how a rule is to be enforced, and only when that occurs. Not every arbiter decision will be listed here, only those that impact the enforcement of rules in the future.
8.2 Regarding “3.1.3 Abusing members of the community” the Arbiters clarified that the mod committee has the right to strike instances of abuse outside of the RSC discord in any RSC context.
8.3 Regarding: 3.5.4 Attempting to bypass punishments: The Arbiters clarified that so long as it is disclosed before the punishment is up so strikes can be properly applied to the main account, simply using an alt and breaking rules is not an instance of “attempting to bypass punishment.” ​
​
8.4 Regarding 3.1.10: Arbiters ruled inconsistent application of this rule had been taken place, as suggested by an arbiter, an announcement was made that stricter enforcement will be taking place.

## 9 Reinstatement and Probationary Period

### 9.1 Purpose

9.1.1 The purpose of this section is to outline the process through which banned players can return to RSCC or RSCSC, including the Probationary Period they will be under upon returning from a ban.

### 9.2 Reinstatement

9.2.1 If an individual is banned from RSCC or RSCSC, they must serve a three season (one year) ban from both RSCC and RSCSC. Upon completing their ban, they will be eligible to be reinstated to RSCC and RSCSC.
9.2.1.1 Reinstatement is automatic and requires no appeal process. Upon being banned, the player will be given the date that they are eligible to be reinstated. Once the year has passed, a moderator will reach out to the player to see if they would like to be reinstated, or the player can reach out to a moderator.
9.2.1.2 Players that have previously appealed for Reinstatement and have been unsuccessful will not be granted eligibility for Reinstatement under 9.2.

### 9.3 Probationary Period

9.3.1 Upon being reinstated following a ban, the individual will enter into a Probationary Period. This period will last one calendar month from the day they rejoin the server. During this one month period, any strike received by the individual will result in an automatic and permanent (unappealable) ban from RSCC and RSCSC.
9.3.2 If the individual receives a strike after the initial Probationary Period has ended, they will automatically be placed under another Probationary Period lasting a calendar month. If the individual gets another strike during this period, they will be automatically and permanently banned from RSCC and RSCSC. This cycle will repeat indefinitely for three seasons (one year), after which the individual will be subject to the same moderation as the rest of the members of the servers.
