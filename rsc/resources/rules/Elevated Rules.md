All GMs are reviewed following incidents of concern after every season, and may lose their position to other candidates if the GM has shown themselves to be unable to meet these expectations.
4.1.7.​ GMs are not required to be a player for their team, though they are permitted to be. The GM must express their desire to be a player before the signup deadline.
4.1.8.​ GMs are the ultimate authority for their franchise. GMs can delegate responsibilities to other members of their franchise; however, the GM will always be the main point of contact with Admins, League Staff, and other franchises for all league activities.
4.1.9.​ GMs may not be on the Transactions or Numbers Committee. GMs may choose to vacate their role as GM between seasons to join one of these committees.

#### 4.2.​ Assistant General Managers

4.2.1.​ GMs can nominate Assistant General Managers (AGMs) to join them in managing their franchise.
4.2.1.1.​ To nominate an AGM, the GM will post in their transaction channel similar to a sign including the name, role, and a screenshot.
4.2.1.2.​ To remove an AGM, the GM will post in their transaction channel similar to a cut including the name and the request to remove from AGM.

4.2.3.​ Draft Eligible players may not be AGMs.
4.2.4.​ A GM is allowed to replace an AGM one time per AGM their franchise is allowed by the rules. For example, if a franchise is allowed two AGMs by the rules, they are also allowed two switches of who is AGM per season. These switches are counted from the release of the tier maker to elevated roles until the end of the season.
4.2.5.​ If a GM takes over midseason, they are allowed to switch all of their AGMs one time, without using their allotted switches.
4.2.6.​ If a GM has less than their allotted AGMs, appointing AGMs to reach the number allowed does not count as one of their switches.

#### 4.3.​ Poaching

###### 4.3.1.​ Overview

4.3.1.1.​ Poaching is any communication, action, suggestion, or implication that a GM, AGM, or Captain of a team or franchise is interested in acquiring a player currently on contract prior to getting written approval from the player’s GM or AGM.
4.3.1.1.1.​ Contract rules are found in the RSC Rulebook.
4.3.1.1.2.​ This includes simple statements of interest in acquiring a player, inviting that player to a tryout, or casually questioning to judge a player's interest in playing for a different team.
4.3.1.1.3.​ This also includes instances where a GM, AGM, or Captain uses another player to circumvent these restrictions.

###### 4.3.2.​ Explanation and Reasoning

4.3.2.1.​ Poaching players is a serious offense that undermines the integrity of a league with multi-season contracts and a draft. Poaching removes agency in team creation from other GMs and removes player value in a trade negotiation and has a negative impact on the league as a whole. Evaluating a poaching incident is often subjective and relies heavily on witness testimony and timestamped written evidence, but poses a serious risk to competitive integrity in a tier and requires decisive action from RSC Administration. Because of these factors, it's always beneficial to pay attention to the Contract Status of a player and reach out to receive written approval before having any interaction with a player that might be misconstrued as a poaching attempt.

###### 4.3.3.​ Penalties

4.3.3.1.​ Any suspected violation of the poaching rule should be reported to an Admin either directly or through ModMail.
4.3.3.1.1.​ It is understood that by reporting poaching via ModMail, all elevated roles who can see ModMail intake (Admins, Head Mod, and any ModMail helpers) will also see this report.
4.3.3.1.2.​ It is understood that poaching allegations will be taken very seriously, and falsely reporting poaching may result in punishment.
4.3.3.1.3.​ It is understood that discussion of poaching allegations outside of any investigations currently in progress may inhibit active investigations.
4.3.3.2.​ The first infraction of the Poaching Rule carries a 1 year (3 season) ban from **any** franchise position or other elevated role.
4.3.3.3.​ A second infraction of the Poaching Rule carries a permanent ban from holding any elevated position in RSC.
4.3.3.4.​ This includes, but is not limited to GM, AGM, Captain, and any role which meets the elevated role definition in this document.

## 5.​ Offseason Operations

5.1.​ Once the current season has been completed as outlined in the RSC Rulebook, the offseason will begin.
5.2.​ The offseason begins with the following tasks:
5.2.1.​ Admin Nomination/Election
5.2.2.​ GM Selection
5.2.3.​ Rules Committee Election
5.2.4.​ Committee Head Elections
5.3.​ Work that does not require those groups may continue under the guidance of those who are not up for re-election.
5.4.​ All committee head elections, staff promotions, and AGM selections will be monitored or hosted by an Admin.
5.5.​ All changes to the RSC Rulebook and league structure should be made in the Offseason. Rules discussions can occur during the season, but no major changes to the rulebook will occur midseason.
5.5.1.​ Admins reserve the right to change the rulebook midseason in the case of an extreme extenuating circumstance.
