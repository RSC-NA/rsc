## Log In

Navigate to https://devleague.rscna.com in your browser and login with Discord then click on the check in button. **You cannot check in until 10 minutes prior to combines starting.**

## Check In

Check in on the same page by hitting the "Check In" button.

## Wait for a discord ping containing your match info

Now that you are checked in, keep an eye on the #combines-announcements channel for a ping that your lobby is ready. Lobby info along with a direct link to your voice chat channel will be included. **The home team creates the lobby and the away team uploads the replays.**

## Report score and upload replays

After you have played your 3 matches, the away team will need to upload the replays. The person that created the lobby will report the score and the person from the away team that is uploading the replays will verify the score **after** uploading the replays. It is usually the person on the top of the list that is responsible for uploading the replays. If you are unsure how or are on a console, coordinate with your teammates on who will upload the replays. You can also ask the home team if you don't have anyone on your team capable of uploading them.
Note: Replays can usually be found in the following directory. `Documents\My Games\Rocket League\TAGame\Demos`

## Queue again!
If you want to play another series, you **MUST CHECK IN AGAIN**. Just repeat the steps above!
