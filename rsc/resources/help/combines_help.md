# :test_tube: RSC Combines Beta Test :test_tube:

## A New Way To Ball :soccer:
Historically, combines have been a mix of experiences for everyone. For some, it's their first time playing games and participating in RSC. For others, it's a casual time during the offseason to either scout around for future teammates or try to make a case for being a valuable player to draft. But due to limitations in our technology, we've always just created tons of empty 10-person voice-channels and let everyone come and go in lobbies throughout the night. This is great for the folks looking for some casual games, but for a new player trying to prove themselves, trying to play a serious game of RL in a 10-person VC with everyone chatting and goofing around isn't the best environment for showing off your skills. **We can do better!**

## New Tech, New Options :desktop:
By leveraging the Dev League software, we've created a new system for Combines that combines the best of Discord with the power of the RSC Numbers Committee and creates a new experience. Now, combines will be individual 3-game series that start in batches every 15-20 minutes every **Monday, Wednesday, and Friday** from **8PM ET** through to **11PM ET** (or when participation starts to dwindle).

This system also allows us (for the first time) to do a full, in-depth analysis of each player's skill directly compared against other people in that same "tier" and skill level. We're going to hopefully use these serious Combine games to help our Numbers Committee get a better sense of how each player plays in relation to the other people in their tier. **More Data == More Competitive Tiers!** :teacher_tone1::first_place:

# How Do I Play?
Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, go to https://devleague.rscna.com and check in for a Combines Match. Every 15=20 minutes new lobbies will be generated. You'll receive an invite to join a specific VC channel with your team and will receive information about the lobby. If you are selected as the person to make the lobby, please make sure that you have the game set as a normal 3v3 with no modifiers, in US-E, and on one of the normal legal maps authorized for use in RSC (DFH Stadium, Mannfield, Urban Central, Champions Field, Wasteland, Aquadome).

## Joining the Game
Once all 6 players are in the match, the game will begin using normal RSC Rules. The Home Team will have a person designated to make the lobby. All 6 players should join the lobby immediately. Once all six are in the game, the Away team will join the field and the Home team will follow immediately thereafter. Each session is a **3-Game Series**. It is **NOT** a Best of 5 or a Best of 3. It is a 3-game series. It is possible to have a 2-2 tie in RSC, and this is critical for stat capture.
## Replays
The Away Team will be responsible for capturing Replays for **ALL THREE GAMES**. If you are on a console or otherwise unable to capture a replay when you are selected as the replay person, **YOU** are responsible for having someone else on your team grab the replays. Your entire lobby will be unable to check in for another series until the scores have been reported **AND** all three replays have been uploaded.
## Score Reporting
Once the three-game series is complete, the two team captains from _BOTH_ teams must report the score, either on the RSC Dev League website (https://devleague.rscna.com) or via the Discord bot commands (`/combine score HOME_SCORE AWAY_SCORE`) Once the score has been reported and verified, the Away team must upload all three replays onto the website or through the bot.
